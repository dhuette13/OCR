# OCR
An Optical Character Recognition Android Application using the Tesseract API.

## Git commands
All of these commands must be run from the root of your project directory.
- Clone the repository: **git clone https://github.com/dhuette13/OCR.git**
  - The address specifed will be saved as a remote. After this you can push and pull without specifying an address for       the github repository
  - Clone will only have to be used once to get an initial copy of the project. After that push and pull are used to         interact with the server.
- Stage your changes: **git add .**
  - This will only add your changes to a temporary staging area, not to your actual local repository.
  - The . refers the the current working directory, so this command adds all items in your current working directory to the staging area.
  - Changes must be staged before they can be commited
- Commit your changes locally: **git commit -m "Enter commit message"**
  - This will add your changes to your local git repository. But not to github
  - The commit message is necessary for all commits, its just a short description of what you changed.
- Push changes to github: **git push**
  - Merges the changes in your local repository to the github repository 
  - Must enter username and password for github
  - If someone has pushed since your last pull, you will have to pull the new additions before you can push your changes.
- Pull new changes to local repository: **git pull**
  - Fetches changes from github and merges them with your local copy of the project. 
  - If you have made local changes to the project, you must commit them locally before you can pull new changes.
- For your first use of git, it will require you to enter a name and email for identifying changes:
  - **git config --global user.name "John Doe"**
  - **git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com**
